# Quantum Quill Swift

The Quantum Quill Swift Package have extensions and function for the daily use and for a cleaner code.

Some of the extensions are from this [Site](https://betterprogramming.pub/24-swift-extensions-for-cleaner-code-41e250c9c4c3). Thank you to Alisa "Foxicorn" Nekrasova for this great article. This article was the inspiration for this swift-package. All other extensions I found it at the last years or write it self.
